# Welcome! 

**This package is in the alpha stage of testings.**

`sAwMIL` provides  Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) models built on support vector machines. It is inspired by the outdated [misvm](https://github.com/garydoranjr/misvm) package. Our package supports two **QP backends**: [Gurobi](https://gurobi.com) and [OSQP](https://osqp.org/).

## Single-Instance SVMs

1. **SVM** (Single-Instance SVM)

## Multiple-Instance SVMs

1. **NSK** (Normalized Set Kernel) [@gartner2002multi]
   See the exapliner on [NSK][sawmil.nsk.NSK] class for details.
2. **sMIL** (Sparse MIL)
